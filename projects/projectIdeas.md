Cat Piss: CRISPR Anotation Tool for Parsing In Silico Sequences

1) Precompute activation, deletion, and interference CRISPR guide RNAs for any genome (uploaded FASTA) for all genes (uplodaed gff3). 

Note: interference CRISPR guide RNAs need TSS to be included in gff.

2) Compute activation, deletion, or interference CRISPER guide RNAs on a user targeted locus in a genome FASTA.

Project Desc:  

The volume of sequencing data being produced continues to out-pace the ability to store and efficiently manage it. I propose a software development project to build a command-line application for managing and archiving data files with a Git-like interface. The software is envisioned to 1) traverse directories on a file system and archive only new or modified files, providing a non-redundant data store; 2) detect files with identical contents (but not necessarily identical names) to already-archived files via SHA checksums; 3) perform file comparison and only store differences (changes) in file contents using time-stamped tarballs; 4) store user-defined file/project metadata; 5) implement an interface to search for and list previously-archived files; and 6) retrieving all root files and apply changes while unarchiving.

 

**Programming concepts required by the project:**

1.   Use of common Python data structures, especially dictionary insertion and look-up

2.   Using modules (including os, sys, pickle, subprocess, hashlib)

3.   Interfacing with the operating system using built-in Python functions and the subprocess module

4.   Implementing depth-first and breadth-first recursive algorithms




# 3. Command Line Adventure Game

Project Desc:  


The main goal of this project was to create a command line adventure game. In this game, a user first fills out a personality quiz, which generates a character for them. Each character comes pre-set with certain attributes which can change throughout the game. This game creates an object class called "user" which creates a user object with a series of attributes and methods. This object is then used in a game script that calls multiple modules individually written by team members. The user object is adjusted based on encounters in the game.

This game incorporates the following programming concepts:

1.   Accept terminal input from the player to prompt actions

2.   Construct object classes with an abstract interface for characters.

3.   Modular programming. Each situation a user is presented with in the text-based game world is a different module to be loaded in a main command script. Given a well-planned character object development, programmers will be able to construct scenarios (i.e., modules) that plug into the main program.

4.   Use the `random` module to introduce an element of chance into the gameplay.

5. Create modules that can be called for formatting output.

DNA sequence analysis: kmer words


DNA is not a random sequence of bases, rather it comprises kmers that are over-represented ('DNA words'). This project will analyze reference genome sequences to find all such DNA words, running statistical tests to determine which are over-represented, and subsequent analysis will investigate relationships between these words and known motifs and/or functions. Then, we will convert these motifs into English (based on word use abundance) and use Python's natural language toolkit to search for chance occurrences grammatical comprehensibility.  






# 6 RNASeq Analysis Pipeline with Mystery Unaligned Reads

TeamName: RNA1   

GitHub Repo:[Link](https://github.com/kirstengott/pfb2019_rna1)

Participants:

Project Desc:  

Build a Python Pipeline for RNAseq Analysis which includes trimming, aligning, quantifying, and testing for differential expression. Then take all unaligned reads and identify your contaminate/symbiote/organelle. 

To enrich your differential expression analysis incorporate transcript annotation/Gene Ontology/Pathways/Panther.

Is any of the differential expression between samples potentially caused by variants? Call SNPs and predict variant effect on transcripts.
